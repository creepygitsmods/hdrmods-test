## Website Purpose

The heart and soul of the site, and the guides contained within, is to help blend the worlds of the **HDR Purist:** *who mainly uses ReShade as a tool to fix a game's HDR or to add HDR if the game doesn't natively support it*, and the **ReShader:** *who uses ReShade to fix, enhance, or otherwise
change a game's visuals to something that is more to their liking.*  

The website's long-term goals include providing regular HDR news updates and provide some history / interesting trivia behind some of the popular HDR mods and the developers who made them possible.


## Contributors

The website and Discord server were created primarily by **Creepy (CreepySasquatch)**, who also does most of the work maintaining both.  
- Creepy is an experienced troubleshooter who works as an IT Project Technician during the day.  
- They got into ReShade and HDR in 2023 and have since taught many people how to use shaders such as Pascal Gilcher's RTGI with HDR. 
- when Creepy noticed a lack of documentation on how to use ReShade with HDR, they decided that someone should do it and it may as well be them.
- Creepy also runs a glorified emoji server, **[HDR Wasteland](https://discord.com/invite/yRYASQrg8r)**, if you're into that kind of thing.  It was originally meant to serve as a companion server to this website, but that role has now been delegated to the HDR Den and RenoDX Discord servers.  

**Soop (smolbbsoop)** helped with the creation of the HDR Wasteland Discord server and is the creator of the HDR converter that is essential to getting non-HDR shaders working with native HDR and mods like RenoDX.
- Soop's shaders can be found within the ReShade installer or at their Github page: <https://github.com/smolbbsoop/smolbbsoopshaders>
